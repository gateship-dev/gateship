# Gateship

Gateship is a local software-delivery runtime for coding agents. An operator
defines a task, Gateship gives it an isolated worktree, runs the selected local
Claude Code or Codex client, verifies the written acceptance commands, asks an
independent read-only reviewer to inspect the change, and ships the result
through a squash-merged pull request.

The product is web-first and local-first: Bun serves the UI on `127.0.0.1`,
SQLite stores run state and activity, and no terminal keystrokes or tmux session
sit on the execution path.

## Requirements

- Docker Desktop on Windows and macOS, or Docker Engine with the Compose
  plugin on Linux, is the recommended installation when host portability is
  required. The image includes the provider and GitHub CLIs.
- Native macOS and Linux installs require Claude Code and/or Codex CLI with a
  subscription login and [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) authenticated
  with `gh auth login --web` and `gh auth setup-git`.
- Bun 1.2.3 or newer is required only when running from source.
- Git with permission to create branches and worktrees in the target repository

Gateship executes the operator's signed-in `claude` or `codex` binary. It
passes agent children an allowlisted environment, never reads provider
credential files, and does not use an Agent SDK. GitHub shipping uses the
credential store owned by `gh`, never an ambient PAT.

## Install

For a portable installation across Windows, macOS and Linux, use the
[container image](#container). Native binaries are a convenience for macOS and
Linux; Gateship does not ship a native Windows binary.

Install the latest native macOS or Linux binary:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gateship-dev/gateship/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer places `gateship` and the shorter `gship` alias in
`~/.local/bin` by default. Override the destination with
`GATESHIP_INSTALL_DIR`.

To build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gateship-dev/gateship.git
cd gateship
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build:release
./dist/gateship-darwin-arm64 --version # example: Apple Silicon
```

For development, commands can run directly through Bun:

```bash
bun index.ts --help
```

## Update

Re-run the same installer; it replaces an existing installation in place.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gateship-dev/gateship/main/install.sh | bash
gship --version
```

`gship --version` confirms what is installed, and the web header shows the
same version next to `gateship`. Pin a specific release instead of the newest
one with `GATESHIP_VERSION`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gateship-dev/gateship/main/install.sh | GATESHIP_VERSION=vX.Y.Z bash
```

Native installations can opt in under **Settings → Gateship updates**. The
switch is off by default. The existing Gateship process checks official
releases at most once a day, verifies the release tag's commit, the current
platform asset, `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and the candidate's own `--version`, then
hands off only while there is no non-terminal run or active diagnostic.

The handoff blocks new work, atomically replaces both installed names from
files prepared on the same filesystem, and verifies `/api/snapshot` after the
restart. A candidate that does not return the exact release version and commit
is stopped; the previous binary is restored, restarted, and verified. Success,
rollback, check errors, and explicit rollback failures remain visible in
Settings. The manual installer above remains the recovery and explicit-update
path.

## Quick start

For an existing project, start the local control surface from its GitHub clone:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
gship
# prints http://127.0.0.1:7777
```

For a new project, create a repository with `main`, then start Gateship inside
the clone:

```bash
gh repo create OWNER/REPO --private --add-readme --clone
cd REPO
gship
```

On first load the web interface checks only local Git metadata: the `origin`
URL and the local `origin/main` ref. It never fetches or creates a repository
implicitly. If the directory is empty or incomplete, the operational surfaces
show the exact recovery command while `/settings` remains available for agent
subscription setup. A running process cannot switch its own working directory;
after changing the project path, restart Gateship from the intended clone.

`gship --port 8080` selects another port. Runtime configuration and provider
sign-in belong in the web interface rather than separate CLI subcommands.
The operator name and IANA timezone are optional settings: the browser suggests
its timezone, but Gateship stores it only after an explicit save.

### Agent CLI

Shell-capable agents can use the running service through the versioned,
machine-readable interface without starting another runtime or reading
`.gship` directly:

```bash
gship agent guide
gship agent operations
gship agent call status.get
gship agent call issues.get --input '{"issueId":"GSHIP-690"}'
```

A minimal reusable instruction for Codex or Claude Code is: “Run
`gship agent guide`, consult `status.get` before acting, use this CLI as the
source of truth, never edit `.gship` directly, and never invent operator
approval.” Every agent command emits one JSON object without ANSI or progress
output. Use `--url http://127.0.0.1:PORT` when the existing local service uses
a different port.

From the browser you can:

1. describe and refine the work with an external agent, which invokes typed
   Gateship commands;
2. maintain the project brief as the durable handoff between external sessions,
   then authorize the task explicitly;
3. let decisions interrupt the work and wait for you as `Needs you`;
4. follow progress as `Working`, with public agent text, tool names,
   verification, and review over SSE;
5. enable local browser notifications, so a run that needs an operator
   decision reaches you outside the tab;
6. switch between Claude and Codex without losing durable run state;
7. run an optional advisory React diagnostic against an isolated exact-SHA
   checkout, manually or on a daily/weekly schedule while the project is idle,
   then dismiss a finding or promote it into an unapproved task;
8. use the explicit controls as a deterministic fallback.

Diagnostics are deliberately outside the delivery gate. They do not auto-fix,
approve or start work, and no diagnostic score can block shipping. The initial
React adapter is version-pinned, requests structured output with telemetry and
scoring disabled, and keeps its download cache under `.gship/diagnostics`
instead of installing anything into the project. A complete scan may clear a
pending finding that no longer appears; a partial scan never claims absence.
The schedule is off by default and belongs to the same Gateship process. A
manual scan resets the same cadence; no host cron, daemon or background queue
is required.

Every newly created run also records the Gateship source/build revision in its
durable creation event. The closed-by-default benchmark panel on `/runs`
replays the recent 50-run window into revision cohorts and keeps outcomes,
human attention, correction rounds, provider holds, wall time, known cost and
provider/model/effort visible as separate facts. Legacy runs without a recorded
revision stay in ordinary history but are excluded from cohort comparison.
There is no evaluator model, synthetic score or automatic approval.

## Container

The Linux container is Gateship's canonical portable distribution. Its
multi-architecture image runs through Docker Desktop on Windows and macOS and
Docker Engine on Linux, with `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` variants under the
same release tag. It contains the compiled binary, git, the GitHub CLI, the
Claude Code CLI and the Codex CLI, with the port it already uses answering the
same UI. Native macOS and Linux binaries remain a convenience.

The image pins both provider CLI releases in `provider-cli-versions.json`.
Renovate checks the official Claude Code releases and the official
`@openai/codex` package weekly, grouping changes into one reviewed dependency
PR. The PR must pass the repository gates, including the image build and CLI
smoke checks; a failed install or unexpected `--version` blocks delivery.
Gateship also disables Claude Code self-updates in child sessions, so a run
cannot silently replace the executable behind its recorded workflow revision;
rebuilding and releasing the image is the explicit upgrade boundary.

A instalação nativa mantém as CLIs fora da imagem e deve ser atualizada pelos
instaladores oficiais do próprio operador. No container, as versões efetivas
vêm exclusivamente da imagem imutável: verifique-as com
`docker compose exec gateship claude --version` e
`docker compose exec gateship codex --version`. Uma run nunca instala nem
atualiza uma CLI.

The update panel may report a newer release from a container, but automatic
apply is unavailable there. Gateship never receives the Docker socket and does
not attempt to recreate its own container; selecting a new image remains a
host-side operation. Source checkouts likewise report why native apply is
unavailable instead of rewriting development files.

Every release publishes one multi-architecture manifest to the GitHub
Container Registry. Both the version tag and commit tag resolve to that
manifest, whose images carry the same baked-in `GSHIP_BUILD_SHA`, release
version and build provenance as the native release artifacts. Run these
commands from a Gateship checkout containing `compose.yaml`, replacing the
example release, projects directory and initial repository path. The repository
path is relative to the projects directory, not an additional host path.

### POSIX shells

```bash
export GATESHIP_IMAGE=ghcr.io/gateship-dev/gateship:v1.2.3
export GATESHIP_PROJECTS_DIR=/path/to/projects
export GATESHIP_PROJECT_PATH=product
docker compose up -d
# http://127.0.0.1:7777, published to loopback only
```

### PowerShell

```powershell
$env:GATESHIP_IMAGE = "ghcr.io/gateship-dev/gateship:v1.2.3"
$env:GATESHIP_PROJECTS_DIR = "C:\path\to\projects"
$env:GATESHIP_PROJECT_PATH = "product"
docker compose up -d
# http://127.0.0.1:7777, published to loopback only
```

Compose uses long bind-mount syntax so an absolute Windows drive-letter path
is accepted without a Windows-specific compatibility layer.
`GATESHIP_PROJECTS_DIR` is mounted at `/projects`, and
`GATESHIP_PROJECT_PATH` chooses the startup repository below it. Leaving both
project variables unset mounts the current directory and selects it, preserving
the one-project default. Leaving `GATESHIP_IMAGE` unset keeps the local
source-build path available for development. For that path, `GSHIP_BUILD_SHA`
optionally bakes the current Gateship commit into the image just as
`scripts/build-release.sh` does for native binaries; release images always
receive it from the release workflow.

Provider and GitHub authentication happen inside the container, on first boot,
and persist on the single `gateship-state` volume mounted at
`/var/lib/gateship` -- never copied from the host, since on macOS the Claude
CLI keeps its credential in the Keychain and there is no host credential file
to mount. The selected repository's runtime database and worktrees remain in
`<repo>/.gship` on the projects bind:

```bash
docker compose exec gateship claude auth login
docker compose exec gateship codex login --device-auth
docker compose exec gateship gh auth login --web
docker compose exec gateship gh auth setup-git
```

The Codex command is its supported headless subscription flow: follow the URL
and enter the displayed device code. `CODEX_HOME` persists that login on the
same volume as Gateship state. Claude and GitHub CLI keep their own stores on
that volume under the same credential-blind boundary; Gateship never reads or
copies their credentials and no API key is required. Ajustes > Providers also
offers an optional dedicated Claude subscription token, isolated from this
external login; see
[Credentials and notifications](docs/credentials-and-notifications.md#dedicated-claude-credential).

Recreating the container from the same image and the same volume returns the
operator to the same place: the same SQLite state, the same managed
worktrees, and the same provider and GitHub CLI logins.

Compose keeps the image filesystem read-only, provides only an ephemeral
`/tmp`, prevents privilege escalation and drops every Linux capability except
the two filesystem capabilities needed for bind-mounted repositories whose
host uid differs from the container's. The project mount and the named state
volume remain writable by design.

### Atualização e recuperação

Atualizações são explícitas e devem usar uma tag versionada com o digest
SHA-256 do manifesto, por exemplo:

```bash
export GATESHIP_IMAGE=ghcr.io/gateship-dev/gateship:v1.2.3@sha256:<digest>
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

Antes de atualizar, pare o serviço e faça backup do volume único e do diretório
`.gship` do projeto. O backup do volume pode ser exportado pelo Docker Desktop
ou pela sequência `mkdir -p ./backup` seguida de
`docker compose cp gateship:/var/lib/gateship ./backup/gateship-state`.
Guarde o digest anterior. Para rollback, restaure o backup se necessário,
retorne `GATESHIP_IMAGE` ao digest anterior e execute `docker compose up -d`.
Não remova `gateship-state` durante atualização ou recuperação.

Para diagnosticar uma instalação, execute `docker compose exec gateship
gship doctor --json`. O diagnóstico verifica arquitetura `linux/amd64` ou
`linux/arm64`, imagem container, permissão do volume, Git, `gh`, Claude, Codex,
os logins, conectividade local e responde apenas com estados, sem credenciais.

## Runtime flow

```text
operator task
  -> external conversational agent
  -> typed Gateship command
  -> remote-main backlog record
  -> isolated .gship/worktrees/<run>
  -> selected Claude/Codex implementation session
  -> acceptance-command verification
  -> independent read-only review through the same provider
       -> one automatic fix attempt when findings exist
       -> operator guidance if findings remain
  -> commit + push + pull request
  -> squash auto-merge after CI
  -> refresh origin/main
  -> release the clean managed worktree and local branch
```

The task specification is the execution contract. Gateship does not require a
planner to rewrite it or an auditor to negotiate with the planner. Verification
runs the commands in the direct `spec: { scope, verify, evidence? }` contract;
human approval covers every executable command in that record, and an issue
with no `verify` commands fails preflight. Review is a separate fresh session
with mechanically read-only capabilities.

## Main commands

```text
gship                       Start the web runtime on 127.0.0.1:7777
gship --port N              Start it on another port
gship --help                Show the CLI surface
gship --version             Print the installed version
```

## Architecture

The current runtime is deliberately small:

- `src/commands/web.ts`: localhost HTTP routes and production composition;
- `src/runtime/run-runtime.ts`: run state machine and cancellation ownership;
- `src/runtime/run-store.ts`: SQLite runs and append-only events;
- `src/runtime/git-workspace.ts`: isolated worktree creation from
  `origin/main`, terminal release, and safe leftover inspection without moving
  local `main`;
- `src/runtime/agent-session.ts`: provider-neutral session contract;
- `src/runtime/agent-process.ts`: shared child/process-group lifecycle;
- `src/runtime/child-env.ts`: allowlisted agent and GitHub CLI environments;
- `src/runtime/claude-cli-*`: Claude stream-json execution and locked review;
- `src/runtime/codex-cli-*`: Codex JSONL execution and built-in read-only review;
- `src/runtime/codex-app-server.ts`: managed ChatGPT browser login without
  exposing tokens to Gateship;
- `src/runtime/git-runtime.ts`: source preflight and deterministic verification;
- `src/runtime/github-shipper.ts`: idempotent commit, PR, auto-merge, and source
  refresh;
- `webui/`: React/Vite operator interface bundled with the release.

The provider boundary and the admission rule for optional local-agent adapters
are documented in [docs/agent-providers.md](./docs/agent-providers.md).
Credential ownership and the notification policy are documented in
[docs/credentials-and-notifications.md](./docs/credentials-and-notifications.md).

There is no separate `gshipd`: the `gship` process is already the durable
service. Adding a second daemon would duplicate ownership of the same SQLite
state, child processes, and HTTP lifecycle.

## Durable state and recovery

Run metadata, provider selection, events, the operator-maintained project brief,
and one native cycle-resolver session id per provider live in
`.gship/runtime.sqlite`. The brief is the durable handoff between external
agent sessions. Each run stores its own provider, native session id, and
worktree path. When the service restarts, an unowned in-flight run becomes
`interrupted`; the operator can resume it instead of losing the workspace or
silently starting a duplicate run.

After a confirmed merge, Gateship removes the clean managed worktree, its local
branch, and its stale remote-tracking ref. A run that ends `failed` releases the
same way, with one added condition: its branch must also carry no commit missing
from `origin/main`, so a commit made just before the failure is preserved instead
of being discarded with the workspace. Cleanup is retried on startup. Dirty
worktrees, unowned leftovers, and failed branches with such a commit are
preserved and shown in the web UI.

The runtime source is `refs/remotes/origin/main`. Gateship fetches that ref
before admitting a run and after a merge. It intentionally does not update or
check out the user's local `main` branch.

## Security

By default the HTTP server binds only to `127.0.0.1`, and browser mutations
additionally require a same-origin localhost request. Read routes carry no
authentication of their own -- the loopback bind is their only boundary, same
as before this existed. The [container image](#container) needs
`GATESHIP_BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0` for Docker's published-port proxy to reach the
service at all (it always connects to the container's own network address,
never its loopback), so inside the container that boundary no longer lives in
the service's own bind; it moves entirely to how the port is published on the
host. `compose.yaml` publishes it as `127.0.0.1:<port>` to keep the same
loopback-only guarantee end to end. Publishing that port on any other
interface -- a bare `docker run -p 7777:7777` without pinning it to
`127.0.0.1`, or a compose override that widens it -- exposes every
unauthenticated read route to the network. Adding authentication is a
separate, deliberate decision, not a byproduct of this packaging.

The implementer is intentionally write-capable inside the isolated worktree.
In native mode, the selected Claude Code or Codex process therefore has the
filesystem authority of the user running Gateship. In container mode, its host
boundary is the container and its explicit mounts; the image root is read-only,
privilege escalation is disabled, and Linux capabilities are minimized. The
projects bind and global-home volume are still intentionally visible inside
that boundary; the selected repository keeps its own `.gship` state on the
bind. This is process containment for a trusted single operator, not a
multi-tenant secret sandbox.

The cycle-question resolver is mechanically read-only: Claude exposes only
Read/Grep/Glob with MCP and slash commands disabled; Codex runs in its read-only
sandbox with user configuration/MCP disabled. Review uses the same restrictions
in a fresh independent session. The external agent invokes typed service
commands, while project-brief updates stay explicitly authorized and are
persisted by the service.

Agent and GitHub CLI children receive an environment allowlist, so unrelated
PATs and API keys are not inherited accidentally. Verification commands are
trusted project commands and retain the service environment. Gateship has no
web or SQLite field for provider or GitHub credentials; see the documented
[credential boundary](./docs/credentials-and-notifications.md). The selected
provider CLI necessarily receives access to its own login store; “credential
blind” means Gateship does not parse, copy, return or persist that credential,
not that the process using it is cryptographically separated from it.

The current executable flow and component ownership are summarized in
[FLOW.md](./FLOW.md). Git history and
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gateship-dev/gateship/releases) retain
older implementation and release detail without keeping obsolete runtime
archives in the published checkout.

## Development

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run typecheck
bun test
bun run check:all
```

The ship/CI gate runs type checking, tests, linting, and dead-code analysis.
Use focused tests while editing; run the full gate once before shipping.
