 * decision (GSHIP-659). No new capture: every event this reads already exists
 * because the runtime records its transitions as decisions by construction.
 *
 * The run's own first entry into `working` is the launch, not a correction,
 * so it is never counted. `run.review-fix-requested`,
 * `run.full-verify-fix-requested` and `run.merge-conflict-fix-requested` are
 * raised by the runtime itself, mid-run, with no operator turn possible in
 * between -- always `executor`. Every other
 * round starts at `run.started`, which fires both for that first launch and
 * for every later resume; a resume is `decision` only when the event
 * immediately before it is `run.operator-guidance` -- exactly what
 * `resumeRun` emits, synchronously, right before it. Any other resume (e.g.
 * recovering an interrupted run with no guidance) matches neither rule, so it
 * is reported `indeterminate` rather than attributed by supposition. The one
 * exception is a `run.started` replay while a durable orchestrator continue
 * response is still unconsumed: that reopens the same correction round and is
 * not a second origin, with or without recovery guidance.
