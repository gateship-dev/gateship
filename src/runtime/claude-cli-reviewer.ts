// src/runtime/claude-cli-reviewer.ts
//
// The independent reviewer role: a headless Claude CLI child that judges the
// change a run produced, and cannot touch it.
//
// Independence is a session property. Every review gets a brand new
// `--session-id`; `--resume` is never passed, so no reviewer inherits the
// implementer's context and its own reasoning about why the change is correct.
//
// Read-only is a capability property, not a prompt instruction, and an
// allowlist alone does NOT deliver it. Measured on 2026-08-15 against the
// installed CLI (2.1.233) by reading the `system/init` event of a real child:
// with only `--allowedTools Read,Grep,Glob --disallowedTools Bash,Edit,Write,
// NotebookEdit,Agent`, the child still reported 105 tools, 5 inherited MCP
// servers and 153 slash commands -- including Workflow, Skill, ToolSearch,
// RemoteTrigger and write-capable MCP tools such as Supabase apply_migration
// and Google Drive create_file. `--allowedTools` only PREAPPROVES; it never
// removes anything from the surface.
//
// Each of the three surfaces is therefore closed by the flag that owns it:
//   * `--tools Read,Grep,Glob` restricts the BUILT-IN set (`claude --help`:
//     "the list of available tools from the built-in set").
//   * `--strict-mcp-config` plus an empty `--mcp-config` drops every inherited
//     MCP server, which `--tools` does not govern.
//   * `--disable-slash-commands` drops the skills surface.
// `--permission-mode dontAsk` then denies anything outside the allow rules
// instead of prompting, so a locked-down `--print` run cannot stall or
// escalate, and `--disallowedTools` stays as a hard deny backstop.
// The same measurement over the resulting argv reports exactly
// ["Glob","Grep","Read"], zero MCP servers and zero slash commands.
//
// `--safe-mode` adds a fourth guard on every headless session: all inherited
// customization off, auth and permissions untouched. Same measurement on
// 2026-08-16 (CLI 2.1.233) still reports ["Glob","Grep","Read"], zero MCP
// servers and zero slash commands, with the child authenticated.
//
// The reviewer therefore cannot run `git diff` itself: the service collects
// the change with its own git seam and passes it in the prompt.
