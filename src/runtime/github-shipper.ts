// src/runtime/github-shipper.ts
//
// The ship role: turn the verified change sitting in a run's own worktree into
// a merged pull request, and report merged only when GitHub really merged it.
//
// Two invariants shape the whole file:
//
//   * The issue is closed on the BRANCH, never on main. `stage:'shipped'` is
//     written into the worktree copy of .gateship/issues/<ID>.json and rides
//     the same commit as the change, so main learns the issue shipped by
//     composing the merge. Nothing here ever writes refs/heads/main.
//   * Every step is idempotent. A repeated ship reuses the commit it already
//     made (nothing staged, no second commit) and the pull request already open
//     for the branch (`gh pr list --head`), so retrying after a GitHub or CI
//     failure never duplicates either.
//   * Once GitHub confirms the merge, the runtime source ref is refreshed
//     before the ship reports merged, so the next run starts from the commit
//     this one landed. That refresh writes `refs/remotes/origin/main` only.
//
// Auto-merge is armed with `--match-head-commit <sha>`, the exact commit we
// pushed, but that pin is GitHub's promise, not ours: a branch moved outside
// the service has been merged with the armed auto-merge still in place. So the
// ship keeps the sha it pushed and re-checks it on every poll against the pull
// request's own `headRefOid`. A head that is not the one we published ends the
// ship as a failure — no merge, no re-arming, no branch deletion — and reports
// merged only while the head GitHub merged is still the head we pushed. Ending
// the ship is not enough on its own: the arming outlives this process, so a
// refused head is disarmed with `--disable-auto` before the failure is
// reported, or GitHub could still land it with nobody watching. A pull
// request closed without merging gets the same take-down (GSHIP-641): it is
// the other ending that would otherwise leave a previous arming intact, and a
// closed pull request can be reopened later with nobody watching either.
//
// Every `gh` command receives an allowlisted environment with no token
// variables, so authentication always belongs to gh's own credential store.
//
// Every `gh` failure passes through the single #checked classification point:
// GitHub being unavailable (HTTP 5xx, a timeout, or a network or name
// resolution failure gh itself reports) from GitHub deciding the answer is no
// (a conflict, a denied permission, a refusal). Only the four commands this
// file already documents as idempotent — reusing the pull request, arming
// auto-merge, reading its state, and updating the branch to clear BEHIND —
// retry an unavailable answer, with a small fixed number of attempts and
// total window, before giving up. A decision fails on the spot, exactly as
// before. When the retries reading the pull request's state run out, the
// ship ends as unconfirmed rather than failed: GitHub may already have
// merged the commit and simply could not be asked, which is not the same
// thing as it refusing to (GSHIP-625).
//
// A pull request the monitor finds BEHIND is a third category, next to
// unavailability and decision (GSHIP-625): using intake to archive, approve
// or promote during a run commits to main outside this ship, so the branch
// falls behind and GitHub refuses to merge it — nobody decided against the
// change and GitHub was never unreachable, the branch is just stale. The
// monitor updates the branch itself and keeps watching instead of waiting out
// the merge timeout, then fetches and hard-resets this ship's own worktree to
// the resulting head — without that sync this ship's next push would be
// rejected as non-fast-forward, exactly the idempotent-retry invariant above
// this update is not allowed to break. `gh pr update-branch` returns as soon
// as GitHub accepts the request, but the update itself lands asynchronously,
// so the head is reread until it changes from the one this ship published,
// with a small fixed number of attempts and a short interval between them,
// before any of that sync or registration happens (GSHIP-656). `mergeStateStatus`
// leaving BEHIND is not trusted as confirmation on its own: GitHub invalidates
// and recomputes mergeability as soon as `update-branch` is requested and
// reports UNKNOWN while it does, so a reread fired in that window can already
// read as "not BEHIND" before the head has moved at all. The evidence for
// GSHIP-656 was a `gh pr view` fired immediately after `update-branch` that
// still returned the head this ship had already published — registered as
// though it were the new head, then read back moments later as a divergence
// from itself once the real update landed. Exhausting the attempts without
// the head changing ends the ship with its own reason instead of registering
// a head this service never confirmed. Only a confirmed head is registered as
// the head this ship published, which is the point the recovery turns on:
// without it, the next poll would read the update as a head moved outside
// the service and the GSHIP-615 guard would end the ship over its own
// recovery. That
// guard still has to refuse a head moved by anyone else, so only a poll that
// finds the head unchanged from what this ship last published is read as
// BEHIND and resolved; any other head still ends the ship as a divergence.
// Branch updates are capped at a small fixed number per ship so a main that
// never stops advancing cannot turn this into an infinite loop; exhausting
// the cap ends the ship with that reason stated plainly. GitHub staying
// unavailable while updating the branch or reading the result ends the ship
// as unconfirmed, the same as any other read (GSHIP-625): the update may have
// already landed and simply could not be confirmed.
//
// BLOCKED is a fourth category the monitor only used to wait out (GSHIP-646):
// GitHub reports BLOCKED for several reasons, and a required check it has
// already completed in failure is one of them — a decision, in the same
// classification GSHIP-625 drew 503 out of, not unavailability and not a
// wait. The evidence was the GSHIP-639 run: CI failed, the pull request went
// BLOCKED, and the monitor kept polling BLOCKED for the rest of the
// hour-long timeout with nothing to show for it. So a BLOCKED poll on the
// head this ship still recognises as its own asks GitHub for the pull
// request's required checks and ends the ship the moment one of them is
// reported completed in failure, naming it in the failure and in its own
// event, with the same auto-merge take-down (GSHIP-616) every other
// non-merge ending here already performs — no merge, no branch deletion. A
// required check still running leaves BLOCKED exactly the wait it already
// was. `gh pr checks` is read outside `#checked`: its documented exit codes
// mean failure and pending checks can both leave a non-zero exit sitting
// next to a perfectly good JSON answer on stdout, so whatever the exit code,
// stdout that parses as the checks array is trusted over it — only a stdout
// that does not parse falls back to the exit code to tell an unavailable
// answer from a decision. GitHub staying unavailable retries with the same
// fixed backoff as the four commands above, but exhausting that budget here
// does not end the ship at all, unconfirmed or otherwise: unlike reading the
// merge state itself, this is a second opinion the ship can simply ask for
// again on the next poll.
