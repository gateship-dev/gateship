# Gateship repository instructions

For architecture work, read `HANDOFF.md` before acting. It records the current
operator-approved direction and evidence, but it is not blanket authorization
to implement the roadmap.

## Product boundary

Gateship is one web service, packaged as one container image. Bun serves the UI,
SQLite stores durable run state and provider adapters invoke coding agents that
are installed in the image and authenticated by the operator on first boot.

- Simplicity governs scope. Prefer removing obsolete surface or fixing a small
  root cause over adding a gate, policy, compatibility layer, daemon or state
  file.
- One image, one volume, one process supervising its children. The container is
  the isolation boundary and replaces the local-process sandbox the roadmap had
  planned. Do not add tmux, send-keys, sidecars, terminal UIs or a second
  `gshipd` process, and do not split the runtime across several containers.
- Provider and GitHub authentication happens inside the container and persists
  on the volume. Never copy host credentials into the image, and never trade the
  operator's subscription login for API-key billing.
- The external agent is the operator's primary conversational interface. It may
	 investigate the project, refine intent and invoke typed Gateship commands.
	 The project brief is the only durable handoff between external sessions.
  The deterministic runtime, not the conversational agent, owns run state,
  verification and shipping.
- The operator specification is the execution contract. Do not require planner
  and auditor convergence before work can start.
- Keep review independent and read-only. A run's explicit recovery budget
  bounds automatic correction across execution, verification, review, full
  verification and CI; once it is spent, or a decision needs a human, the run
  stops at waiting-user with the reason and next step, never silent consent.
  A run with no recovery policy keeps the legacy one-bounded-fix behavior.

## Agent and workspace lifecycle

- Keep provider authentication credential-blind: Gateship may inspect auth
  status, but must not read, copy or store OAuth tokens or API keys.
- Give agent and GitHub CLI children an explicit environment allowlist. Never
  add a provider/GitHub token field to the web UI or runtime database; GitHub
  authentication belongs to `gh`'s credential store.
- Keep remote notification services optional and server-side. Their secrets
  must never enter SQLite, browser responses, logs or agent environments; add a
  concrete channel before considering a generic integration bus.
- Cut run worktrees from fresh `origin/main`. Never move or check out the
  operator's local `main` branch.
- After a confirmed merge, release the clean managed worktree, local branch and
  stale remote-tracking ref. Preserve dirty, failed or unknown leftovers and
  surface them to the operator.
- Keep role contracts in provider adapters: the cycle resolver handles typed
  cycle questions, the executor edits only its assigned worktree, and a fresh
  reviewer session is mechanically read-only.

## Runtime and dependencies

- Use Bun commands (`bun`, `bun test`, `bun run`, `bunx`, `bun install`).
- Use `Bun.serve` and `bun:sqlite`; do not add an application framework or a
  separate database service.
- The React UI is built with Vite because Tailwind v4 requires its build-time
  plugin. Vite is not part of the shipped runtime.
- Prefer existing platform APIs over new packages.
- Any change that touches the web UI follows the design contract in
  `docs/design/design-system.md`.

## Verification

- Run the smallest relevant tests while editing. Gateship verification runs the
  task's explicit commands; `bun run check:all` is the once-per-ship/CI spine,
  not a loop after every small change.
- Add tests for observable behavior and destructive or failure boundaries, not
  for duplicated registries, implementation wording or retired compatibility
  paths.
- Do not weaken correctness to make a gate pass. Remove a low-value gate only
  when the protected surface is also removed or covered by a clearer contract.

Do not add AI-attribution trailers to commits or pull-request text.
